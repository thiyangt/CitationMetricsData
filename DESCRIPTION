Description: This package provides access to a publicly available database of top-cited scientists, offering standardized citation metrics and author performance indicators. The dataset includes information on total citations, h-index, co-authorship adjusted hm-index, citations by authorship position, and a composite c-score. Separate metrics are available for career-long impact (updated to end-of-2023) and single-year impact (citations received during 2023). Data taken from "Ioannidis, John P.A. (2024), “August 2024 data-update for "Updated science-wide author databases of standardized citation indicators"”, Elsevier Data Repository, V7, doi: 10.17632/btchxktzyw.7".
